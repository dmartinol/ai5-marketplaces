  **CRITICAL**: This skill must be used for ALL CVE discovery and listing queries. DO NOT use raw MCP tools like get_cves directly.

  Use this skill when users request:
  - Listing critical/high-severity CVEs: "show me critical vulnerabilities", "what are the most critical CVEs", "list all high-severity vulnerabilities"
  - CVE discovery: "what vulnerabilities affect my account", "show me all CVEs", "what are my security risks"
  - CVE impact analysis for specific CVEs: "what's the impact of CVE-X?", "analyze CVE-Y"
  - Risk assessment: "which CVEs are most urgent?", "prioritize vulnerabilities"
  - Understanding affected systems for a CVE
  - Comparing CVE severity levels
  - CVE discovery and prioritization (information gathering)

  DO NOT use this skill when users request remediation actions like:
  - "Create a remediation playbook" (use remediator agent)
  - "Patch CVE-X on system Y" (use remediator agent)
  - "Remediate these CVEs" (use remediator agent)

  This skill orchestrates MCP tools (get_cves, get_cve, get_cve_systems) to provide comprehensive CVE analysis with Red Hat Lightspeed context. When users ask for remediation after seeing the analysis, transition to the remediator agent.

  **IMPORTANT**: ALWAYS use this skill instead of calling get_cves or other vulnerability MCP tools directly.

# CVE Impact Analysis Skill

This skill helps SREs analyze CVE vulnerabilities to understand their impact on systems before creating remediation playbooks.

**Integration with Remediator Agent**: The remediator agent orchestrates this skill as part of its Step 1 (Impact Analysis) workflow for complex remediation scenarios. For simple standalone impact analysis, you can invoke this skill directly.

## Prerequisites

**Required MCP Servers**: `lightspeed-mcp` ([setup guide](https://console.redhat.com/))

**Required MCP Tools**:
- `get_cves` (from lightspeed-mcp) - List/query CVEs by severity
- `get_cve` (from lightspeed-mcp) - Get specific CVE details
- `get_cve_systems` (from lightspeed-mcp) - Find systems affected by CVEs

**Required Environment Variables**:
- `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID` - Red Hat Lightspeed service account client ID
- `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET` - Red Hat Lightspeed service account secret

### Prerequisite Validation

**CRITICAL**: Before executing any operations, invoke the [mcp-lightspeed-validator](../mcp-lightspeed-validator/SKILL.md) skill to verify MCP server availability.

**Validation freshness**: Can skip if already validated in this session. See [Validation Freshness Policy](../mcp-lightspeed-validator/SKILL.md#validation-freshness-policy).

**How to invoke**:
```
Use the Skill tool:
  skill: "mcp-lightspeed-validator"
```

**Handle validation result**:
- **If validation PASSED**: Continue with CVE impact analysis
- **If validation PARTIAL**: Warn user and ask to proceed
- **If validation FAILED**: Stop execution, provide setup instructions

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill directly when you need**:
- Standalone CVE impact analysis without remediation planning
- Quick risk assessment for a single CVE
- Understanding which systems are affected by a CVE
- CVE severity assessments for change management documentation
- Risk assessment reports for management

**Use the remediator agent when you need**:
- CVE analysis followed by remediation playbook generation
- Complex workflows involving multiple CVEs and systems
- Integrated risk assessment + remediation planning + execution guidance
- Batch remediation across infrastructure
- End-to-end CVE management (analysis → validation → remediation → verification)

**How they work together**: The remediator agent orchestrates this skill as part of its comprehensive workflow, combining impact analysis with context gathering, playbook generation, and execution guidance. The agent uses the skill's analysis capabilities and extends them with remediation planning.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Validate Lightspeed MCP Prerequisites

**Action**: Invoke the [mcp-lightspeed-validator](../mcp-lightspeed-validator/SKILL.md) skill

**Note**: Can skip if validation was performed earlier in this session and succeeded. See [Validation Freshness Policy](../mcp-lightspeed-validator/SKILL.md#validation-freshness-policy).

**How to invoke**:
```
Use the Skill tool:
  skill: "mcp-lightspeed-validator"
```

**Handle validation result**:
- **If validation PASSED**: Continue to Step 1
- **If validation PARTIAL**: Warn user and ask to proceed
- **If validation FAILED**: Stop execution, user must set up MCP server

### Step 1: List Critical CVEs (Optional - For Discovery Queries)

**Use this step when users ask**: "What are the critical vulnerabilities?", "Show me high-severity CVEs", "List all vulnerabilities on my account"

**CRITICAL**: Document consultation MUST happen BEFORE tool invocation.

**Document Consultation** (REQUIRED - Execute FIRST):
1. **Action**: Read [vulnerability-logic.md](../../docs/insights/vulnerability-logic.md) using the Read tool to understand CVE severity classification and filtering logic
2. **Output to user**: "I consulted [vulnerability-logic.md](../../docs/insights/vulnerability-logic.md) to understand CVE severity classification and filtering."

**MCP Tool**: `get_cves` or `vulnerability__get_cves` (from lightspeed-mcp)

**Parameters**:
- `impact`: `"7,6"` (string with comma-separated impact levels where 7=Important, 6=Moderate, 5=Low)
- `sort`: `"-cvss_score"` (sort by field with `-` prefix for descending order; valid fields: "cvss_score", "public_date")
- `limit`: `20` (maximum number of CVEs to return)

**Expected Output**: List of CVEs with metadata (CVE ID, CVSS score, severity, affected system count, remediation availability)

Retrieve all CVEs affecting the account, filtered by severity:
```bash
# Get all CVEs with Important and Moderate severity (impact levels 7, 6)
# Sorted by CVSS score descending
get_cves(
  impact="7,6",
  sort="-cvss_score",
  limit=20
)

# Example tool invocation after document consultation:
# Step 1: Read vulnerability-logic.md (required)
# Step 2: Output "I consulted..." message (required)
# Step 3: Call MCP tool with correct parameters:

vulnerability__get_cves(
  impact="7,6",
  sort="-cvss_score",
  limit=20
)

# Expected output:
CVE-2024-1234 (CVSS 9.8, Important) - kernel
  Affected systems: 15
  Remediation: Available

CVE-2024-5678 (CVSS 8.1, Important) - httpd
  Affected systems: 8
  Remediation: Available

CVE-2024-9012 (CVSS 7.5, Important) - openssl
  Affected systems: 25
  Remediation: Available
```

**After listing CVEs**:
- Sort by CVSS score (highest first) or by number of affected systems
- Provide summary table with CVE ID, severity, affected systems count, remediation availability
- Offer to analyze any specific CVE in detail (use Step 1 below)
- Offer to create remediation plan (transition to remediator agent)

### Step 2: CVE Information Retrieval (For Specific CVE Analysis)

**CRITICAL**: Document consultation MUST happen BEFORE tool invocation.

**Document Consultation** (REQUIRED - Execute FIRST):
1. **Action**: Read [cvss-scoring.md](../../docs/references/cvss-scoring.md) using the Read tool to understand CVSS score interpretation and severity mapping
2. **Output to user**: "I consulted [cvss-scoring.md](../../docs/references/cvss-scoring.md) to understand CVSS score interpretation and severity mapping."

**MCP Tool**: `get_cve` or `vulnerability__get_cve` (from lightspeed-mcp)

**Parameters**:
- `cve_id`: Exact CVE identifier from user query (format: `"CVE-YYYY-NNNNN"`)
  - Example: `"CVE-2024-1234"`
- `include_details`: `true` (retrieve complete metadata including CVSS vector, affected packages, references)

**Expected Output**: Comprehensive CVE metadata including CVSS score, severity, attack vector, affected packages, remediation status

Retrieve comprehensive CVE metadata:
```
CVE ID: CVE-YYYY-NNNNN
CVSS Score: X.X (Base score from NIST)
Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low
Attack Vector: Network/Adjacent/Local/Physical
Attack Complexity: Low/High
Privileges Required: None/Low/High

```

### Step 3: Affected Systems Identification

**CRITICAL**: Document consultation MUST happen BEFORE tool invocation.

**Document Consultation** (REQUIRED - Execute FIRST):
1. **Action**: Read [insights-api.md](../../docs/insights/insights-api.md) using the Read tool to understand the system identification response format
2. **Output to user**: "I consulted [insights-api.md](../../docs/insights/insights-api.md) to understand the system identification response format."

**MCP Tool**: `get_cve_systems` or `vulnerability__get_cve_systems` (from lightspeed-mcp)

**Parameters**:
- `cve_id`: Exact CVE identifier (format: `"CVE-YYYY-NNNNN"`)
  - Example: `"CVE-2024-1234"`
- `include_patched`: `false` (exclude already-patched systems to focus on vulnerable systems)

**Expected Output**: List of affected systems with UUID, hostname, IP address, package version, vulnerability status

Identify which systems in your infrastructure are affected by the CVE:
```
Affected Systems:
- system-uuid-1 (hostname: web-server-01, IP: 10.0.1.10)
  - Package: httpd-2.4.37-1.el8
  - Status: Vulnerable

- system-uuid-2 (hostname: web-server-02, IP: 10.0.1.11)
  - Package: httpd-2.4.37-1.el8
  - Status: Vulnerable

Total Affected Systems: N
```

### Step 4: System Classification

**CRITICAL**: Document consultation MUST happen BEFORE classification logic.

**Document Consultation** (REQUIRED - Execute FIRST):
1. **Action**: Read [fleet-management.md](../../docs/insights/fleet-management.md) using the Read tool to understand system tagging and classification strategies
2. **Output to user**: "I consulted [fleet-management.md](../../docs/insights/fleet-management.md) to understand system tagging and classification strategies."

Classify affected systems by environment and criticality based on tags from Red Hat Lightspeed:
```
System Classification:
- Production systems: N (highest priority)
- Staging systems: M (test before prod)
- Development systems: K (lowest priority)
- Bare metal: X systems
- Virtual machines: Y systems
```

### Step 5: Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL**: Document consultation MUST happen BEFORE risk assessment.

**Document Consultation** (REQUIRED - Execute FIRST):
1. **Action**: Read [cvss-scoring.md](../../docs/references/cvss-scoring.md) using the Read tool to understand risk prioritization based on CVSS vectors
2. **Output to user**: "I consulted [cvss-scoring.md](../../docs/references/cvss-scoring.md) to understand risk prioritization based on CVSS vectors."

Provide a risk assessment based on:
- CVSS score and severity
- Number of affected systems
- System criticality (production vs non-production)
- Attack vector and exploitability
- Known exploits in the wild

**Output Format**:
```

**Next Steps**:
- Analyze any specific CVE for details: "Analyze CVE-2024-1234"
- Create remediation plan: "Remediate CVE-2024-1234 on all affected systems"
```

4. Wait for user to request specific CVE analysis or remediation
5. If user says "remediate CVE-X", respond: "I'll transition to the remediator agent to create the remediation playbook"

### Example 1: High-Severity CVE Analysis

**User Request**: "Analyze the impact of CVE-2024-1234"

**Skill Response**:
1. Retrieve CVE details using `get_cve`
2. List affected systems using `get_cve_systems`
3. Classify systems by environment and criticality
4. Provide risk assessment and recommendations
5. Suggest next steps (use remediator agent if remediation needed)

### Example 2: Multiple CVE Comparison

**User Request**: "Compare the impact of CVE-2024-1234 and CVE-2024-5678"

**Skill Response**:
1. Retrieve details for both CVEs
2. Create comparison table (CVSS, severity, affected systems)
3. Recommend prioritization order
4. Suggest batch remediation if both should be fixed together

### Example 3: Environment-Specific Analysis

## Integration with Remediator Agent

After completing impact analysis, the skill should:

1. **Suggest transition to remediation** if risk is high:
   ```
   Based on this analysis, immediate remediation is recommended.

   Would you like me to create a remediation playbook?
   (This will use the remediator agent)
   ```

2. **Provide context for remediation**:
   - CVE ID
   - Affected system UUIDs
   - Recommended execution method (AAP/Tower/Manual)
   - Suggested maintenance window

## Error Handling

**CVE not found**:
```
CVE-YYYY-NNNNN was not found in the Red Hat CVE database.

Possible reasons:
- CVE ID is incorrect
- CVE is too recent and not yet in database
- CVE doesn't affect RHEL systems

Suggestions:
- Verify CVE ID format (CVE-YYYY-NNNNN)
- Check NVD database: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search
- Try alternative CVE IDs if this is an alias
```

**No affected systems**:
```
CVE-YYYY-NNNNN Analysis Complete

Good news! No systems in your infrastructure are affected by this CVE.

Possible reasons:
- Your systems are already patched
- Affected packages are not installed
- Systems are running different versions

No action required.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always start with risk assessment** before deciding on remediation
2. **Check for known exploits** using CVE description and references
3. **Consider business impact** not just CVSS scores
4. **Group related CVEs** for batch remediation when possible
5. **Document findings** for compliance and audit purposes
6. **Test in staging first** for high-impact changes
