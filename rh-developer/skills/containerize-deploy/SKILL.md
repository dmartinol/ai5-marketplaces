# /containerize-deploy Skill

Provide a complete, guided workflow from local source code to running application on OpenShift or standalone RHEL systems. This skill orchestrates `/detect-project`, `/s2i-build`, `/deploy`, `/helm-deploy`, and `/rhel-deploy` with clear user checkpoints at each phase.

## Overview

```
[Intro] → [Detect] → [Target] → [Strategy] ──┬─→ [OpenShift Path] ─────┬─→ [Complete]
                        │                    │   [S2I/Podman/Helm]      │
                        │                    │                          │

                        │
                   User chooses target:
                   - OpenShift → Strategy selection (S2I/Podman/Helm)
                   - RHEL → Delegate to /rhel-deploy skill
```

**Deployment Targets:**
- **OpenShift** - Deploy to OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster (S2I, Podman, or Helm strategies)
- **RHEL Host** - Deploy to standalone RHEL system via SSH (delegates to /rhel-deploy)

**OpenShift Deployment Strategies (if OpenShift target selected):**
- **S2I** - Source-to-Image build on OpenShift, then deploy (Phases 3-7)
- **Podman** - Build from Containerfile/Dockerfile on OpenShift, then deploy (Phases 3-7)
- **Helm** - Deploy using Helm chart (Phase 2-H)

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Introduction

```markdown
# Containerize & Deploy

I'll help you containerize and deploy your application to OpenShift or a standalone RHEL system.

**What this workflow does:**
1. **Detect** - Analyze your project and determine the best deployment strategy
2. **Choose Target** - Deploy to OpenShift cluster or RHEL host
3. **Build** - Build container image (S2I or Podman) or skip if using Helm with existing image
4. **Deploy** - Deploy using Kubernetes resources, Helm chart, or systemd services

**Deployment Targets:**
- **OpenShift** - Deploy to OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster
- **RHEL Host** - Deploy directly to a RHEL system via SSH

**OpenShift Strategies:**
- **S2I (Source-to-Image)** - Build and deploy from source code
- **Podman** - Build from existing Containerfile/Dockerfile
- **Helm** - Deploy using Helm chart

**RHEL Strategies:**
- **Container** - Run with Podman + systemd
- **Native** - Install with dnf + systemd

**What I need from you:**
- Confirmation at each step before I make changes
- Access to an OpenShift cluster OR SSH access to a RHEL host
- Your project source code

**Ready to begin?** (yes/no)
```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

### Phase 1: Project Detection

Execute the `/detect-project` workflow.

**If Remote URL provided:**
Follow the "Remote Repository Strategy" path in `/detect-project`.
- Ask user to choose: Remote S2I, Remote Podman, or Clone.

**If Local Files:**
Proceed with standard detection.

```markdown
## Phase 1: Analyzing Your Project

[If Local]
Scanning project directory for language indicators...

[If Remote]
Analyzing remote repository options...

...
```

Store confirmed values in session state, including `BUILD_STRATEGY` and `HELM_CHART_DETECTED`.

### Phase 1.4: Deployment Target Selection

```markdown
## Deployment Target

Where would you like to deploy this application?

| Target | Description | Requirements |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **OpenShift** | Deploy to OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster | `oc login` access |
| **RHEL Host** | Deploy directly to a standalone RHEL system | SSH access to RHEL 8+ |

**Which target would you like to use?**
1. OpenShift - Deploy to current cluster
2. RHEL - Deploy to a RHEL host via SSH
```

Store `DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in session state.

**If user selects "RHEL":**
- Store `DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = "rhel"` in session state
- Delegate to `/rhel-deploy` skill with detected project info
- Pass: `APP_NAME`, `LANGUAGE`, `FRAMEWORK`, `VERSION`, `BUILDER_IMAGE`, `CONTAINER_PORT`
- The `/rhel-deploy` skill handles SSH connection, deployment strategy, and service creation
- After `/rhel-deploy` completes → Go to **Phase 8 (Completion)**

**If user selects "OpenShift":**
- Store `DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = "openshift"` in session state
- Continue to Phase 1.5 (Strategy Selection)

### Phase 1.5: Strategy Selection

If multiple deployment options are available (Helm chart detected, Dockerfile present, or standard project):

```markdown
## Deployment Strategy

Based on my analysis, you have these options:

| Strategy | Use When | Detected |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **S2I** | Standard apps, no Dockerfile needed | [Yes/No] |
| **Podman** | Custom Containerfile/Dockerfile exists | [Yes/No] |
| **Helm** | Helm chart exists or complex deployments | [Yes/No] |

**Detected in your project:**
[List what was found: language indicators, Dockerfile, Helm chart at ./chart]

**Which deployment strategy would you like to use?**
1. S2I - Build with Source-to-Image
2. Podman - Build from Containerfile/Dockerfile
3. Helm - Use existing Helm chart
4. Create Helm chart - Generate a new Helm chart for your project (if no chart exists)
```

Store `DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY` in session state.

### Phase 1.6: Image Selection (S2I/Podman only)

If user selected S2I or Podman deployment strategy, offer image selection options:

```markdown
## Image Selection

**Current recommendation:** `[builder-image]`
(Based on: [language] [version])

**Image Selection Options:**
- **quick** - Use the recommended image (good for most cases)
- **smart** - Run `/recommend-image` for tailored selection (production vs dev, security, performance)

Which option would you prefer?
```

**If user selects "smart":**
- Invoke `/recommend-image` skill with detected `LANGUAGE`, `FRAMEWORK`, `VERSION`
- Store the result in `BUILDER_IMAGE` and `IMAGE_VARIANT` session state
- Continue to Phase 2

**If user selects "quick":**
- Use the already-detected `BUILDER_IMAGE`
- Continue to Phase 2

**BRANCHING LOGIC:**
- If `DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY` is **"S2I"** or **"Podman"** → After Phase 2, continue to **Phase 3 (S2I/Podman Path)**
- If `DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY` is **"Helm"** → After Phase 2, go to **Phase 2-H (Helm Path)**

### Phase 2: OpenShift Connection

```markdown
## Phase 2: Connecting to OpenShift

Checking cluster connection...

**Current Context:**
| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Cluster | [cluster-api-url] |
| User | [username] |
| Namespace | [current-namespace] |

**Is this the correct cluster and namespace?**
- yes - Continue to build
- no - I need to change this

[If no]
**To change context:**
1. Run `oc login <new-cluster-url>` in your terminal
2. Or run `oc project <namespace>` to switch namespace
3. Then tell me to continue

**Available namespaces you have access to:**
[List first 10 namespaces/projects]

Which namespace should I deploy to?
```

Store confirmed `NAMESPACE` in session state.

---

## S2I/PODMAN PATH (If DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY is "S2I" or "Podman")

### Phase 3: Git Repository Check

```markdown
## Git Repository

I need a Git URL for the S2I build.

**Detected from .git/config:**
- Remote: `[git-url]`
- Branch: `[current-branch]`

**Is this correct?** (yes/no)

[If no git config found]
**Please provide:**
1. Git repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/user/repo.git)
2. Branch name (default: main)
```

Store `GIT_URL` and `GIT_BRANCH` in session state.

### Phase 4: Pre-Build Summary

```markdown
## Phase 3: Build Configuration

Here's what I'll create on OpenShift:

**Target:**
- Cluster: [cluster]
- Namespace: [namespace]

**Resources to Create:**

1. **ImageStream** `[app-name]`
   - Stores built container images

2. **BuildConfig** `[app-name]`
   - Source: [git-url] (branch: [branch])
   - Builder: [builder-image]
   - Output: [app-name]:latest

---

**Would you like to see the full YAML?** (yes/no)

[If yes, show both YAML manifests]

---

**Proceed with creating these resources and starting the build?**
- yes - Create resources and start build
- modify - I need to change something
- cancel - Stop here
```

### Phase 5: Execute Build

```markdown
## Creating Build Resources...

[x] ImageStream created: [app-name]
[x] BuildConfig created: [app-name]

## Starting Build...

**Build:** [app-name]-1
**Status:** Running

---
**Build Logs:**
```
[Stream S2I build output]
```
---

[When complete]

## Build Successful!

**Build:** [app-name]-1
**Duration:** [X]m [Y]s
**Image:** [image-reference]

**CRITICAL: Wait for the build to reach 'Complete' status before proceeding.**

Continue to deployment? (yes/no)
```

If build fails, follow error handling from error-handling-agent.

### Phase 6: Pre-Deploy Summary

```markdown
## Phase 4: Deployment Configuration

**Image ready!** Now let's deploy it.

**Resources to Create:**

1. **Deployment** `[app-name]`
   - Image: [app-name]:latest
   - Replicas: 1
   - Port: [detected-port]

2. **Service** `[app-name]`
   - Internal load balancer
   - Port: [port]

3. **Route** `[app-name]`
   - External HTTPS access
   - URL: https://[app-name]-[namespace].[domain]

---

**Would you like to see the full YAML?** (yes/no)

[If yes, show all three YAML manifests]

---

**Proceed with deployment?**
- yes - Deploy the application
- modify - I need to change something
- cancel - Stop here (build artifacts preserved)
```

### Phase 7: Execute Deployment

```markdown
## Deploying Application...

[x] Deployment created: [app-name]
[x] Service created: [app-name]
[x] Route created: [app-name]

## Waiting for Rollout...

**Pod Status:**
| Pod | Status | Ready |
|-----|-----|---|
| [app-name]-xxx-yyy | Running | 1/1 |

Rollout complete!
```

If deployment fails, follow error handling from error-handling-agent.

---

## HELM PATH (If DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY is "Helm")

### Phase 2-H: Helm Deployment

If user selected Helm in Phase 1.5, execute this path instead of Phases 3-7.

```markdown
## Helm Deployment

Switching to Helm deployment workflow...

The `/helm-deploy` skill will handle:
1. Validate the Helm chart
2. Review and customize values
3. Install/upgrade the release
4. Monitor deployment
5. Present results

Proceeding with Helm deployment...
```

**Delegate to `/helm-deploy` skill:**
- Pass `APP_NAME`, `NAMESPACE`, `HELM_CHART_PATH` from session state
- The helm-deploy skill handles chart detection, values review, and installation
- After helm-deploy completes → Go to **Phase 8 (Completion)**

**If user chose "Create Helm chart":**
- Generate chart using templates from templates/helm/
- Replace `${APP_NAME}` placeholders with detected app name
- Set `${CONTAINER_PORT}` based on detected port
- Then proceed with helm-deploy workflow

---

## COMPLETION (Both paths converge here)

### Phase 8: Completion

```markdown
## Deployment Complete!

Your application is now running on OpenShift.

---

**Application Summary:**

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | [app-name] |
| Namespace | [namespace] |
| Language | [language] |
| Framework | [framework] |

---

**Access URLs:**

| Type | URL |
|---|-----|
| **External** | https://[route-host] |
| Internal | http://[app-name].[namespace].svc.cluster.local:[port] |

---

**Resources Created:**

| Resource | Name | Status |
|----|---|-----|
| ImageStream | [app-name] | Ready |
| BuildConfig | [app-name] | Ready |
| Deployment | [app-name] | 1/1 Running |
| Service | [app-name] | Active |
| Route | [app-name] | Admitted |

---

**Quick Commands:**

```bash
# View logs
oc logs -f deployment/[app-name] -n [namespace]

# Scale up
oc scale deployment/[app-name] --replicas=3 -n [namespace]

# Trigger rebuild (after code changes)
oc start-build [app-name] -n [namespace]

oc delete all -l app=[app-name] -n [namespace]
```

---

**Next Steps:**
- Open your app: [route-url]
- Set up Git webhooks for automatic builds
- Add environment variables: `oc set env deployment/[app-name] KEY=value`
- Configure autoscaling: `oc autoscale deployment/[app-name] --min=1 --max=5`
